          <h3>The Journey To EDC</h3>
          <p>
            From its inception, Electric Daisy Carnival has been based around the recurring theme 
            of "nature meets technology." That may seem obvious from its name, but after 20 years, 
            it's more appropriate than ever. Like a flower, this phenomenon didn't bloom overnight. 
            <br><br>
            This year, our glowing daisy reached new heights of artistic creation and technological 
            innovation. Join us with an open heart, and expect to grow as well. Here, you'll find
            the freedom to reveal a side of yourself that has been waiting to blossom. Dance 
            alongside characters you'd otherwise encounter only in dreams. Smile at new friends
            sharing in this unique experience. Let visual effects tickle your senses, and don't 
            forget to embrace someone as the fireworks ignite the sky. Take time to explore; the act
            of discovery can be more essential than having a plan. Finally, be mindful of the present.
            While two decades of precious moments have come and gone, new memories are yet to be made.
            Be sure to hold on to them as they're happening.
            <br><br>
            As EDC weekend arrives, listen carefully - a faint pulse can be heard in the distance. 
            Look in that direction, and you'll see many coloured lights beginnning to cast their 
            glow across the desert sky. Follow your ears, your eyes, and your heart. Where they
            lead you, an experience unlike any other awaits.
